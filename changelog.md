# jBell Change Log


### 5/3/21
	- Fixed seg fault after adding an alarm by making the current rack a global variable. Member variables are in class scope and were not accessible by the clock thread.
	- Made sure to explicitly call delete on the global Rack to properly delete and audio devices open in the alarms. Globals do not fall out of scope and so are never being destructed, automatically atleast.
	- Changed name of 'MainApp/App' to 'Program'.

### 5/4/21
	- Changed currentRack to be a static member of the Rack class. Makes more sense here. Static vars still need to be explicity deleted.
	- Added a custom wxPanel class to process user key input. It is stored as a member the Frame.

### 5/7/21
	- Switched GUI framework to SFML. wxWidgets was hurting my soul.



## Structural Concepts:
	- To avoid circular dependency issues between parent and child relationships that use each other, forward declare the class in the header file and then include the classes header in the SOURCE file.
	- Store "global" objects as static members of the class that is its type. ? Maybe
